Project: A Historical Analysis of US Unemployment (1948-2021):

## Project Overview:
This capstone project, created for an entry-level data analyst portfolio, provides a comprehensive historical analysis of the US unemployment rate from 1948 to 2021. The primary goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, to uncover key trends and the impact of significant economic events on different demographic groups.

The project addresses the following key questions:

- What are the overall long-term trends in US unemployment?

- How have major economic events, such as the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, impacted the unemployment rate?

- How do unemployment rates compare across different demographic groups, specifically men vs. women and various age groups?

## Key Findings:
The analysis successfully answers the project's core questions and provides a detailed narrative on the evolution of the US labor market. The key findings are summarized in the final report and visualizations generated by the script:

- Cyclicality of Unemployment: The data clearly shows that unemployment is a cyclical economic indicator, with sharp increases during recessions and gradual declines during periods of economic growth.

- Gender-Based Shifts: A long-term trend reversal is observed, where male unemployment, once consistently lower, surged above female unemployment during the 2008 Great Recession, highlighting the disproportionate impact of sector-specific economic crises.

- Age-Related Vulnerability: The data consistently demonstrates that younger workers (ages 16-17) face significantly higher unemployment rates than any other age group, indicating their greater vulnerability to labor market fluctuations.

## Files in This Repository:
- Historical Analysis of US Unemployment (1948-2021).py: The main Python script containing all the code for the project. It handles data loading, cleaning, analysis, and the generation of all visualizations. The script is heavily commented to explain each step of the process.

- Readme_Historical Analysis of US Unemployment.md: A detailed Markdown report summarizing the project's executive summary, key findings, and conclusions.


## Getting Started:
To run this project, you will need to use a Python environment, such as Google Colab, and have access to the dataset.

- Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the US Unemployment Data (1948â€“2021), available on Kaggle. You will need to download this file and upload it to your Google Drive.

- Environment:
This project is designed to be run in a Google Colab notebook for seamless execution. The script includes code to mount your Google Drive, providing a persistent way to access your dataset without having to re-upload it for every session.

- Running the Code:
Open in Google Colab: Create a new Colab notebook and copy the contents of Historical Analysis of US Unemployment (1948-2021).py into a code cell.

  - Mount Google Drive: Run the first code block to mount your Google Drive. You will be prompted to authenticate your account.

  - Update File Path: CRITICAL STEP. The script's drive_path variable is a placeholder. You must update it to reflect the exact path where you saved the unemployment_rate_data.csv file in your Google Drive.

  - Run the Notebook: Execute the rest of the cells sequentially. The script will handle the data processing, generate the visualizations, and print the key findings directly to the output.
